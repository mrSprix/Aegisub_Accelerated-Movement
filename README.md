# Aegisub_Accelerated-Movement
This script can help you accelerate your moves.

Note that this script is specifically designed for masks. Although
you can use it on text, the starting position of the result may be below
the actual move. However, you can adjust that after running the script.
This version of the script does NOT support inline tags. In other words,
there shouldn't be two or more tags of the same type in the line.


This is the first version of the script, and there may be many problems and room for development.
If you encounter any bugs while using this script, please feel free to contact me at fr.3pehr@gmail.com
or on Telegram at @mrSprix.
