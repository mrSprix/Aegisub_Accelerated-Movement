# Aegisub_Accelerated-Movement
This script can help you accelerate your moves.


This version of the script does NOT support inline tags. In other words,
there shouldn't be two or more tags of the same type in the line.


This is the first version of the script, and there may be many problems and room for development.
If you encounter any bugs while using this script, please feel free to contact me at fr.3pehr@gmail.com
or on Telegram at @mrSprix.

Special thanks to PhoenixTetra who made it possible to accelerate moves with his wonderful idea.
